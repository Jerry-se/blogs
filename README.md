### Pelican

There are many tools to build a blog with static websites, such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/), etc. In the end, I chose to use Pelican to implement my blog.

See [how I build a blog with Pelican and Github Pages](https://jerry-se.github.io/build-blogs-with-pelican-and-github-pages.html).
